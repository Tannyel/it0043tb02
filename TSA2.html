            <p>
                Due to Thaniel's lack of playing Dead by Daylight and Genshin Impact, FEU Tech will conduct Synchronous online classes on <font color="green"><strong>April 29 and 30, 2024</strong></font>.
                so that Thaniel will be able to play these games during online classes. Professors are also prohibited to giving assessments during the said Dates. Message Thaniel on Canvas for any Inquiries.
            </p>
            <p>
                All offices will also be shut down so they can watch Thaniel's stream on TWITCH.TV: @Thaniel D. Matibag. Onsite enrollment will also resume on April 31, 2024 onwards. Thank you for understanding.
            </p>
