    <h2 class="h2">Online classes Synchronous Classes on April 29 and 30, 2024</h2>
    <p class="p">
        Due to Thaniel's lack of playing Dead by Daylight and Genshin Impact, FEU Tech will conduct Synchronous online
        classes on <span class="a23">April 29 and 30, 2024.</span>
        so that Thaniel will be able to play these games during online classes. Professors are also prohibited to giving
        assessments during the said Dates. Message Thaniel on Canvas for any Inquiries.
    </p>
    <p class="p">
        All offices will also be shut down so they can watch Thaniel's stream on <span class="TWITCH">TWITCH.TV: @Thaniel D. Matibag.</span> Onsite
        enrollment will also resume on <span class="oe">31, 2024 onwards.</span> Thank you for understanding.
