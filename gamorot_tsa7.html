                    <p class="article-content">P-pop phenomenons BINI have just released their first ever extended-play,
                        titled “Talaarawan”. The highly-anticipated record features the hit tracks “Karera” and
                        “Pantropiko“, as well as four new tracks –– including the EP’s lead single “Salamin, Salamin“.
                        Sheena explained “Talaarawan means diary in English, and just like your diary, you write down
                        your feelings, kung anong nangyari sa araw mo (what happens during your day), yung iba’t ibang
                        emotions in one day (your different emotions in one day), and your diary [eventually] becomes
                        your best friend. Just like with our EP, it’s a rollercoaster ride of emotions with our six
                        songs and we want our Blooms to feel that we are their best friends din.” HomeEntertainment and
                        Celebrity News

                        Since this is their first-ever mini album, BINI tackled the perspective of the youth on
                        friendship, love, and navigating through life. “Talaarwan” features six tracks, including
                        “Salamin, Salamin,” “Ang Huling Cha Cha,” “Na Na Nandito Lang,” “Diyan Ka Lang,” and their
                        recent hits “Karera” and “Pantropiko.”

                        BINI decided to release “Talaarawan” on International Women’s Day to champion their advocacy on
                        women empowerment.

                        “Our advocacy is also women empowerment. We always want to inspire women, and not just women but
                        we want to make sure that people feel confident in their own skin. That’s why I think that March
                        8 is the perfect date,” Mikha told ABS-CBN News.</p>
